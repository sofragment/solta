# solta development roadmap: a chaotic yet purposeful journey :>

here’s where we’re at and where we’re heading. buckle up—it’s gonna be a ride.


## phase 1: core framework 🛠️

[X] basic project structure setup (aka figuring out where stuff goes.)

[X] core agent class implementation (the backbone of solta literally.)

[ ] ollama api client integration (you had one job, api.)

[ ] basic decorator system for agent setup (making code look pretty and functional.)

[ ] error handling and logging system (because “oops” isn’t good enough.)

[ ] agent lifecycle management (startup, shutdown, rinse, repeat.)


## phase 2: agent system 🤖

[X] standard agent template structure (templates for those who like order.)

[ ] agent configuration system (because agents deserve preferences too.)

[ ] agent state management (keeping track of what agents are up to.)

[ ] event system for agent interactions (they gotta talk somehow.)

[ ] agent communication protocols (let’s teach them some manners.)

[X] tool registration system (plug in, power up.)

[X] tool validation system (no bad tools allowed.)

[ ] tool dependency management (tools shouldn’t be codependent.)

[ ] async tool execution support (because waiting is overrated.)

[ ] tool result handling (tools do, results show.)

[ ] built-in common tools library (standard issue awesomeness.)


## phase 3: tool system 🧰

[X] base tool class implementation (where tools become reality.)

[ ] tool discovery and registration (gotta catch ‘em all.)

[ ] tool validation system (no bad tools allowed.)

[ ] tool dependency management (tools shouldn’t be codependent.)

[ ] async tool execution support (because waiting is overrated.)

[ ] tool result handling (tools do, results show.)

[ ] built-in common tools library (standard issue awesomeness.)


## phase 4: ollama integration 🌐

[ ]complete ollama api wrapper (wrapping up the api in a nice little bow.)

[ ] model management system (herding ai models like cats.)

[ ] conversation history tracking (because agents don’t have goldfish memory.)

[ ] context management (remember what we just talked about, please.)

[ ] parameter optimization (making it work, but better.)

[ ] model switching capabilities (because sometimes you need a change.)

[ ] response streaming support (real-time action, no buffering.)


## phase 5: advanced features 🚀

[ ] memory management system (agents gotta have brains too.)

[ ] chain of thought implementation (teaching agents to think out loud.)

[ ] multi-agent coordination (herding more cats.)

[ ] agent templates and presets (plug, play, and slay.)

[ ] performance monitoring (keeping an eye on things.)

[ ] resource management (because agents don’t run on magic.)

[ ] rate limiting and quotas (keeping them in check.)


## phase 6: developer experience 🧑‍💻

[ ] comprehensive documentation (because guessing is the enemy.)

[ ] cli tools for agent creation (type, click, done.)

[ ] local development server (test it before you wreck it.)

[ ] debug tools and utilities (finding and fixing the weird stuff.)

[ ] example agents and templates (for inspiration and lazy days.)

[ ] testing utilities (breaking things for science.)


## phase 7: production ready 🌟

[ ] production deployment guides (getting real-world ready.)

[ ] security hardening (making it hacker-proof—or die trying.)

[ ] performance optimizations (speed is the name of the game.)

[ ] monitoring and analytics (because data is power.)

[ ] enterprise features (fancy business stuff.)

[ ] agent marketplace (build, sell, repeat.)

[ ] official agent examples (here’s what good looks like.)


## phase 8: ecosystem 🌍

[ ] community agent repository (sharing is caring.)

[ ] plugin system (customization made easy.)

[ ] integration with other ai services (let’s play nice with others.)

[ ] community contribution guidelines (so everyone knows the rules.)




did you know some species of jellyfish are technically immortal? unlike them, your agents still need a cleanup function. priorities. :>
