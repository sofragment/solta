# solta: where building ai agents is a breeze (and fun) :>

solta is a python framework for crafting ai agents that interact with the ollama api. inspired by discord.py’s cog system (because why reinvent good ideas?), solta makes creating, managing, and deploying ai agents modular and structured without sucking the fun out of it. whether you’re building a chatbot, a digital butler, or an ai that just judges your Spotify playlist, solta’s got your back. :>

## features 🛠️

•	**agent-based architecture**: build modular ai systems like a pro (or at least fake it convincingly).

•	**ollama api integration**: plug and play with your favorite model (or whichever one you can afford).

•	**standardized structure**: because an organized project is a happy project.

•	**tool system**: give your agents superpowers (tools, capes, whatever floats your boat).

•	**decorator-based commands**: easy-to-use syntax so you can focus on the fun stuff.

## what solta isn’t 🛑

•	**a magical solution**: you still have to write code, sorry.
•	**a life coach**: but hey, you could build one with it.
•	**perfect**: it’s still in alpha, so expect a few rough edges and some chaos. embrace the adventure.

## why solta? 🤔

because ai should be fun, flexible, and a little bit chaotic. solta is for the dreamers, the builders, and the tinkerers who want to create something cool without getting bogged down by overly complicated frameworks or an existential crisis over variable names.

## vibes and structure 🗂️

solta projects are designed to keep your sanity intact. we won’t bore you with the full layout (check the docs for that), but rest assured, it’s clean, modular, and designed for maximum “wow, I actually understand this” energy.

did you know that sloths can hold their breath longer than dolphins? yeah, we didn’t either. solta can’t do that, but it can help you build a sloth-themed chatbot if that’s your vibe. :>

if you’ve made it this far, congrats. now go build something amazing, weird, or hilariously unnecessary. solta’s ready for whatever you throw at it. happy coding! >:>
